## System Architecture

### Overview

Our architecture consists of three layers, with the platform in the middle and users at the edges.

![zk-Lokomotive Module Legend](https://github.com/zk-Lokomotive/zkl-docs/blob/main/diagrams/zkl%20module%20legend%20light.png)

We offer enterprise-level solutions where the platform is fully on-chain for unmatched privacy potential. With the use of a decentralized Cross-Chain Identity Registry (CCIR), we provide identity proving and account management on the blockchain, eliminating any centralized layers where data can be tampered with.

**Enterprise Deployment Module Legend**

![zk-Lokomotive Enterprise Module Legend](https://github.com/zk-Lokomotive/zkl-docs/blob/main/diagrams/zkl%20enterprise%20module%20legend%20light.png)

### Elements

Our infrastructure consists of three main modules, with the JavaScript/Svelte web application comprising four submodules.

#### Modules

1. **JavaScript/Svelte Web Application (Client)**

   The client is the user-facing module of zk-lokomotive, allowing users to send and receive files by linking their wallet accounts.

   **Submodules:**

   - **aus**

     Provides functionality for communicating with distributed file chains and decentralized networks like IPFS. Currently, we utilize Arweave.

   - **roadhog**

     Interfaces with various blockchain networks used in our platform to perform specific objectives by calling or querying smart contracts, Solana programs, etc.

   - **crypto**

     Performs cryptographic operations. We support the Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) through the `ecies/rs-wasm` package, which consumes the Rust crate `eciesrs`.

   - **kds**

     Generates pseudo-random mnemonics using BIP-39 that are then derived into elliptic curve key pairs.

2. **Platform-Level Components**

   - **Cross-Chain Identity Registry (CCIR)**

     The CCIR serves as a decentralized identity and public key management system. It links wallet addresses to their elliptic public keys. On the CCIR, wallet users can only add or modify information about themselves after proving ownership of the private key to that wallet account. Everyone is allowed to query from a public EC key to the wallet address or vice versa.

     - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/zk-Lokomotive/zkl-ccir)

   - **Arweave**

     We use Arweave for decentralized and persistent file storage, providing a decentralized file storage solution.

   - **Inbox**

     Inboxes are on-chain and network-specific implementations. The client calls these using the `roadhog` submodule when querying for incoming files or sending a file.

     The inbox can be logically defined as:

     ```plaintext
     type message = { q_e: string; e_plink: string; uPK: string; }
     let inbox : message StringMap.t ref = ref StringMap.empty
     ```

---

## Key Components

### 1. Key Derivation Service (KDS)

The KDS is a crucial component that provides:

- A deterministic Curve25519 key pair generator derived from BIP-39 mnemonics.
- A pseudo-random BIP-39 mnemonic generator utilizing the `web-bip-39` package.

This service ensures consistent and secure key generation across different platforms and devices.

- [NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zklx/kds)

### 2. Cross-Chain Identity Registry (CCIR)

The CCIR serves as a decentralized identity and public key management system. It allows:

- Lookup of identities across different blockchain networks.
- Retrieval of corresponding public keys for secure communications.

- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/zk-Lokomotive/zkl-ccir)

### 3. Encrypted File Storage (EFS)

The EFS is a distributed storage solution that:

- Allows recipients to retrieve encrypted payloads uploaded for them.
- Utilizes Arweave for decentralized and persistent file storage.
- Ensures data privacy through encryption before storage.

### 4. Client

The client component is responsible for:

- Generating encrypted payloads for recipients.
- Retrieving recipient public keys via the CCIR.
- Initiating the file transfer process.

### 5. Crypto

Provides cryptographic functions for encryption and decryption of both binary data and strings using public and private keys. It utilizes `ecies-wasm` for the underlying cryptographic operations.

- [NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zklx/crypto)

### 6. Wormhole Messaging Module SDK

The zk-lokomotive Ethereum-Solana Wormhole Messaging module facilitates secure and efficient cross-chain communication between Ethereum and Solana blockchains. This implementation leverages modern ES6+ standards to provide a robust, maintainable, and highly interoperable solution for cross-chain messaging needs. By utilizing the Wormhole protocol as its foundation, this module ensures reliable message delivery while maintaining the security guarantees essential for cross-chain operations.

- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/zk-Lokomotive/zkl-eswm-ES6)

**Why ES6?**

Our decision to implement this module using ES6+ standards stems from several key considerations:

- **Modern Development Practices:** ES6 introduces significant improvements in code organization through modules.
- **Enhanced Type Safety:** Integration with TypeScript.
- **Better Asynchronous Handling:** Promises and async/await patterns are crucial in blockchain development.
- **Code Reliability and Maintainability:** Essential for cross-chain operations.
- **Expressive and Concise Code:** Without sacrificing readability or performance.

## Cryptographic Activities

### System Elements

The system elements are described and discussed in the zk-lokomotive System Architecture document.

#### 1. Key Derivation Service (KDS)

Provides:

- A deterministic secp256k1 key pair generator from BIP-39 mnemonics.
- A pseudo-random BIP-39 mnemonic generator through the `web-bip-39` package.

#### 2. Cross-Chain Identity Registry (CCIR)

Allows:

- Lookup of identities and their corresponding public keys across different blockchain networks.

#### 3. Encrypted File Storage (EFS)

A distributed storage solution that allows recipients to retrieve payloads that were uploaded for them.

#### 4. Client

The sender generates the encrypted payload to be sent to the receiver, whose public key is retrieved via the CCIR.

### Workflows

#### Definitions

- **Q<sub>r</sub>:** Recipient’s public key on curve secp256k1.
- **G:** The generator point on curve secp256k1.
- **Z:** A symmetric key derived for the file to be sent, the shared secret.
- **F<sub>c</sub>:** The file contents, in plaintext.
- **F<sub>m</sub>:** File's metadata (name, etc.).
- **F:** The intermediate file format, ready to be encrypted.
- **F<sub>c</sub>:** The file contents, in ciphertext.
- **IV:** The initialization vector required for AES-GCM-256.
- **P:** The payload, what is sent to the recipient.

The intermediate file format **F** is as follows:

| Bytes           | Content                             | Length in Bytes               |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| [0]..4          | Length of **F<sub>m</sub>**         | 4 bytes                       |
| [4]..1024       | **F<sub>m</sub>**                   | 1020 bytes (255 * 4 bytes)    |
| [1024]...       | **F<sub>c</sub>**                   | Variable                      |

#### Workflow: Sending a File

1. Retrieve **Q<sub>r</sub>** from the CCIR.
2. Generate an ephemeral key pair, **Q<sub>e</sub>** and **d<sub>e</sub>**.
3. Compute the shared secret **Z** = **d<sub>e</sub>** × **Q<sub>r</sub>**.
4. Encrypt the intermediate file **F** using AES-GCM-256 with encryption key **Z** and a randomly generated initialization vector, **IV**.
5. Create the payload **P** by concatenating **Q<sub>e</sub>**, **IV**, **MAC**, and **F<sub>e</sub>**.
6. Upload the payload **P** to the Encrypted File Storage (EFS).

> **Note:** The MAC in the payload **P** at step 5 is a result of using AES-GCM-256, which is selected in the ECIES implementation in the Rust crate we consume through the `ecies/rs-wasm` package.

## Deployment Plans 

```
We aim to launch zk-lokomotive on the mainnet in the first quarter of 2025 across Solana, Ethereum, Sui, and Aptos networks. To
prepare for this deployment, we first conducted a thorough analysis of each blockchain’s technical specifications to ensure
compatibility. This involved examining each network’s consensus mechanisms, smart contract structures, and the requirements for
cross-chain (interoperability) integration, particularly through protocols like Wormhole. Our goal is to ensure zk-lokomotive operates
securely and efficiently on each network.
Before the mainnet launch, we subjected all our smart contracts to rigorous security audits and carried out extensive testing on
testnets to gather feedback from the community. These testnet deployments allowed us to assess the platform’s functionality,
performance, and user experience, gathering valuable insights for optimization and addressing potential issues. Through this iterative
process, we strengthened zk-lokomotive, making it more robust and user-friendly.
Now, we’re ready to bring zk-lokomotive to the mainnet, and we plan to deploy it in stages. We’ll begin with networks that have higher
user engagement and transaction volumes, allowing us to scale gradually and make real-time adjustments as user demand grows. By
deploying zk-lokomotive in a phased manner, we can monitor performance and scalability more effectively and respond swiftly if
needed. With the mainnet launch scheduled for early 2025, our primary goal is to establish zk-lokomotive as a secure and reliable
solution across all supported chains. Additionally, we’ve released our SDK packages to make our technical infrastructure accessible to
users and developers alike. For example, developers can access our Key Derivation Service (KDS) SDK at
npmjs.com/package/@zklx/kds and the Cross-Chain Identity Registry (CCIR) on GitHub at github.com/zk-Lokomotive/zkl-ccir, enabling
seamless integration with zk-lokomotive.
To attract users, we are adopting a community-driven approach. We’ve prepared educational content, guides, webinars, and onboarding
materials to help users understand zk-lokomotive’s security and privacy benefits. To encourage early adoption, we offer incentive
programs, including referral bonuses, airdrops, and loyalty rewards. Our referral program, in particular, aims to foster organic growth by
leveraging network effects within the community, helping us expand our user base through word-of-mouth.
Strategic partnerships will also play a key role in our growth. By collaborating with other blockchain projects and dApps that require
secure file transfer, we aim to position zk-lokomotive as a valuable tool within their ecosystems. For developers, we’ve established a
comprehensive support program, hosting hackathons, providing grants, and offering detailed documentation to encourage the
development of new solutions built on zk-lokomotive. Through these efforts, we aim to strengthen our ecosystem with the contributions
of a dedicated developer community.
Our go-to-market strategy focuses on clearly differentiating zk-lokomotive from competitors. The platform’s unique features—such as
cross-chain compatibility, high security via zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), and permanent, decentralized storage with Arweave—are
central to our value proposition. By conducting pilot programs with early users, we’ll be able to showcase real-world use cases, build
success stories, and establish zk-lokomotive as a trusted solution for secure file transfer.
In terms of regulatory compliance and security standards, we are highly attentive to maintaining high levels of security and adherence
to regulations. Positioning zk-lokomotive as a high-security, compliance-ready solution is crucial, especially for enterprise users who
need reliable and regulatory-compliant options. To that end, we’ve built a strong infrastructure to earn and maintain user trust.
Finally, we prioritize a feedback-driven development process. We continually update and enhance zk-lokomotive based on user needs,
aiming to make it a user-friendly and trustworthy platform. By doing so, we aspire to become a leader in secure file transfer across the
Solana, Ethereum, Sui, and Aptos ecosystems, fulfilling the demand for secure, private, cross-chain data transfers.
