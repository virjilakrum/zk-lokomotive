# zk-Lokomotive
File Transfer on Solana with zero-knowledge
**Security Technologies**


![diagram(37)](https://github.com/virjilakrum/zk-lokomotive/assets/158029357/2200dc5c-ff40-4a41-ba37-51b9a9c8206b)

Here's how the interaction between the two parties might work:

- The receiver assigns one RSA public key
  
- The sender encrypts the AES symmetric cipher with this public key
  
- Creates a zkproof when the sender can decrypt the encrypted data
  
- Sends the encrypted key and zkproof to the recipient via p2p somehow **(we need to figure this out)**
  
- Receiver decrypts the aes key, checks the proof and reports that it is ready for file transfer
  
- Sender pins file on ipfs network, assigns hashi to receiver

- Receiver receives the file

# Architecture Definition:

ZK File Transfer is a secure and private method for transferring files between two parties.

## Motivation:

Traditional file transfer methods often lack sufficient privacy and security, especially when sensitive data is involved. Trust between parties cannot be assumed, particularly in remote or decentralized scenarios. Implementing file transfers on a centralized server poses risks of data breaches and privacy violations.

## Solution:

Adopting a decentralized approach to file transfer, utilizing the principles of zero-knowledge proofs (zkSNARKs), can significantly enhance privacy and security. This method allows for the verification of file transmission without revealing the contents of the files to the network or a third party.

## Technical Description:

The ZK File Transfer, process uses advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure that files are transferred securely and privately:

1. **Encryption and Decryption:** Files are encrypted using a shared secret, which is generated through a secure key exchange mechanism (e.g., Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)). This ensures that only the recipient, who possesses the corresponding secret, can decrypt and access the file.
   
![Elliptic-Curve-Diffie-Hellman-ECDH-Key-Exchange-Protocol-Two-users-Alice-and-Bob](https://github.com/virjilakrum/zk-lokomotive/assets/158029357/678ce0b9-d149-42b4-b959-937c9e753b00)

> Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) is an anonymous key agreement protocol that allows two parties, each having an elliptic-curve public–private key pair, to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel. This shared secret may be directly used as a key, or to derive another key. The key, or the derived key, can then be used to encrypt subsequent communications using a symmetric-key cipher. It is a variant of the Diffie–Hellman protocol using elliptic-curve cryptography.

You can choose between 10 standard NIST curves of different sizes. 5 pseudo-random curves and 5 Koblitz curves providing from 80 to 256 bits symmetrically equivalent security.  See [ecdh.h](https://github.com/kokke/tiny-ECDH-c/blob/master/ecdh.h) for clarification.

You can define the macro `ECDH_COFACTOR_VARIANT` in [ecdh.c](https://github.com/kokke/tiny-ECDH-c/blob/master/ecdh.c) to enable the [co-factor variant of ECDH](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/18222/difference-between-ecdh-with-cofactor-key-and-ecdh-without-cofactor-key) for safe non-ephemeral use.

# Binding ECDH on Rust (Ring)

These benchmarks currently only can be built/run using Nightly Rust because
they use Rust's built-in benchmarking feature, and that feature is marked
"unstable" (i.e. "Nightly-only").

```
git clone https://github.com/briansmith/crypto-bench && cd crypto-bench && cargo update && cargo +nightly bench
```

You must use Rust Nightly because `cargo bench` is used for these benchmarks,
and only Right Nightly supports `cargo bench`.

You don't need to run `cargo build`, and in fact `cargo build` does not do
anything useful for this crate.

`./cargo +nightly test` runs one iteration of every benchmark for every
implementation. This is useful for quickly making sure that a change to the
benchmarks does not break them. Do this before submitting a pull request.

`cargo update` in the workspace root will update all the libraries to the
latest version.

`cargo +nightly bench -p crypto_bench_ring` runs all the tests for [*ring*](https://github.com/briansmith/ring).

3. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs for File Integrity:** To verify that a file has been transmitted without revealing its content, zero-knowledge proofs are utilized. These proofs allow the sender to prove that the file matches a publicly agreed-upon hash without disclosing the file itself.

4. **Poseidon Hash for Data Integrity:** The integrity and authenticity of the file are ensured using the Poseidon hash function, a cryptographic hash function optimized for zero-knowledge proofs. This function is applied to the file before transmission, creating a digest that can be securely compared by the recipient.

4. **Decentralized Verification:** The verification process, including the checking of zero-knowledge proofs, is performed on a blockchain network (e.g., Solana). This decentralized approach eliminates the need for a trusted third party, enhancing the security and privacy of the file transfer.

5. **Efficient Data Storage on Blockchain:** To maintain efficiency and minimize blockchain storage requirements, only essential data (e.g., proofs, hashes) are stored on-chain. The actual file remains with the sender and recipient, ensuring privacy.

6. **Server:** The system operates on a peer-to-peer basis, with each participant running the ZK File Transfer client. This design supports direct, secure file transfers without intermediaries.

* WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a technology that enables Web applications and sites to capture and optionally stream audio and/or video media, as well as to exchange arbitrary data between browsers without requiring an intermediary. The set of standards that comprise WebRTC makes it possible to share data and perform teleconferencing peer-to-peer, without requiring that the user install plug-ins or any other third-party software.

    WebRTC Configuration: Use the RTCPeerConnection API to configure the WebRTC connection. Include STUN/TURN servers in the configuration to handle NAT traversal.
    Data Channels: Use RTCDataChannel for transferring the encrypted AES key, zk-SNARK proof, and IPFS hash. This channel can also be used for the actual file transfer if not using IPFS.
    Signaling Implementation: Implement a simple signaling mechanism using WebSockets or any real-time communication library. This is for exchanging WebRTC offer, answer, and ICE candidates.

8. **Client Interface:** The user interface for ZK File Transfer is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to easily send and receive files securely. The cryptographic operations are handled in the background, providing a seamless experience for the user.
